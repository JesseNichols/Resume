// Modules
//
// A Module is a component of the page. It is a navigation
// bar, a carousel, a widget, a dialog, and so on. This is
// the meat of the page. Modules sit inside Layout
// components. Modules can sometimes sit within other
// Modules too. Each Module should be designed to exist as
// a standalone component. In doing so, the page will be
// more flexible. If done right, Modules can easily be
// moved to different parts of the layout without breaking. 
//
// Avoid using IDs and element selectors, sticking only to
// class names. Only include an element selector that 
// includes semantics. A span or div holds none. A heading
// has some. The more semantically generic the HTML element
// (like a span or div), the more likely it is to create a
// conflict down the road.
// 
// Modules should be created in separate files within the
// "modules" directory and imported into this file.

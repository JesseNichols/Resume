// Layout Rules
//
// CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on
// the page. However, there is a distinction between
// layouts dictating the major and minor components of a 
// page. The minor components, such as a callout, or login
// form, or a navigation item, sit within the scope of 
// major components such as a header or footer. Minor,
// reusable components will be referred to as Modules and
// should be placed in the Modules file. The major
// components are referred to as Layout styles and should
// be placed in this file.
